## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      *Please see both visualizations attached to the assigments directory. 

      * refernce for good visualiztion: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/preethilo/viz/AmericasInternationalStudentsTrendsImpactsandChallenges/AMERICASINTERNATIONALSTUDENTS (attached as pdf, I will refere to page 4 in the pdf workbook also attached as an image titled "good visualiztion")

      * reference for bad visualization https://www.statschat.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/who-bought-what.jpg

      *Analysis good visualization: "America's International Students Trends and Impacts" (p.4: "China and India remain the leading international student places of origin"), by Preethi Lodha. 

        This visualization is part of a broader data visualization project that aims to describe and analyze trends in U.S. international students' enrollment. The main visualization is centred, big, and colourful. The Financial Times vocabulary (slide 45, fourth deck) defines this type of visualization as a streamgraph (a subtype of an area chart), which aims to show change over time. This visualization effectively communicates two key trends: the overall increase in the total number of international students in the U.S., and the rising proportion of international students from China and India combined within that total. This visualization is supported by a small figure in the top-left line graph, comprised of two lines: the red line represents the change in the proportion of international students from China and India, and the white line represents international students from the rest of the world. The line graph expands and highlights the story the streamgraph seeks to convey (the growing proportion of Chinese and Indian students in the American academy since the 1960's).  Additionally, the large visualization highlights two key landmarks: in 2011, when the number of Indian and Chinese students surpassed the total number of international students from the rest of Asia, and in 2018, when they overtook the number of students from the rest of the world. It also includes a verbal capture of the latest 2022 data to elaborate on specific data points that cannot be discerned/learned from the streamgraph. 

        The visualization is visually appealing, and the colour choice enhances the story. India and China are represented with very similar colours, emphasizing their likeness, and they are positioned next to each other, which demonstrates their proximity. These choices align with the Gestalt principles outlined by Wong (2010), supporting the interpretation of the visual as a single unit of analysis—the central story the visualizer intended to convey. The understanding of this visualization can be characterized by low intrinsic, germane, and extraneous cognitive loads: the underlying data is simple (the share of international students in the U.S. by country of origin); and most consumers of this data visualization—such as higher education scholars, students, and the general North American public—will likely be familiar with this type of information.

        This visualization meets two of the convictions stated by Kennedy et al. (2016) for data visualization: clean layout and a two-dimensional figure. However, there is no reference to the data sources or to the use of non-geometric shapes and/or straight lines. Streamgraph is not a common visualization for showing trends over time, and it is better at showing general trends and properties rather than specific values. Accordingly, the visualizer added the small line graphs, landmarks, and the capture to support the visualization. Each component in this visualization (capture, landmarks, streamgraph, and line graphs) is not self-explanatory. However, being together makes the visualization easier to understand, with a low cognitive load. 

        Drawing on D’Ignazio and Klein's (2020) claim that data visualization is a rhetorical object, I am interested in understanding the motivations for creating these visualizations and, more importantly, how they are used by different actors (if at all). This visualization can be used to inform policies to support the Chinese and Indian student population in the U.S. (given their growing proportions), but can also be used to promote xenophobic and racist higher education policies. 
      
     *Analysis bad visualiztion: "who bought what: hectares purchased by foreigners in the past five years" 
        
       This visualization employs what The Financial Times vocabulary defines as "ordered proportional symbols." This technique is appropriate when there are significant variations in values or when differences between specific values are not crucial. While this visualization adheres to two of the principles outlined by Kennedy et al. (2016)—namely, being a two-dimensional figure and utilizing geometric shapes—it lacks crucial context and data sources.

        For instance, the term "last five years" is an indexical phrase, which can lead to ambiguity. The visualization's layout is rather messy, lacking a logical spatial organization of the bubbles. The four bubbles representing high values (UK, Canada, Australia, and the U.S.) are arranged one within the other, while medium values are positioned vertically toward the right edge of the visualization. Meanwhile, the smallest values (China and Italy) are represented as small bubbles at the bottom left. This illogical organization increases cognitive load, making it challenging to comprehend why the USA and Canada, and the UK and Australia, are situated within one another.

        These design choices also conflict with the Gestalt principles outlined by Wong (2010), particularly those of similarity and continuity. The lack of context suggests that this visualization targets a specialist audience, which can lead to higher cognitive loads—both germane, stemming from the general public's unfamiliarity with the information and its importance, and extraneous, resulting from the unorganized design choices mentioned above.

        Given that data visualizations are rhetorical objects, the narrative this visualization seeks to convey is unclear. Understanding the creator's intentions would be helpful. Is it aiming to inform international investors interested in purchasing land in a foreign country? Or is it intended to reflect specific nations' policies regarding land, such as selling land for international investors while reducing public housing?

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Good visualiztion:
      - adding a data source/sources. 
      
      Bad visualization:
      - Use ordered proportional symbols consistently and systematically.  
      - Ensure more organized and systematic/consistent use of space.  
      - Include the data source or sources.  
      - Add details about the visualizer.  
      - Clarify the time range to which the phrase "last five years" refers.  
    
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
